The remains of deceased players who lost their humanity wandering through the endless fields of the nether.

Lost souls are passive entities resembling a decomposed version of their former selves. The continuous influence of the nether gave them a tenuous link with the physical world, just enough to be vulnerable against another player's attack, though not so much as to be hurt by most other hazards.

When they are killed, they drop a sample of ectoplasm that can be further processed to suit a player's needs.
