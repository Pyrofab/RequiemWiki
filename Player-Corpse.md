This special entity is spawned whenever a player drinks [[Eau de Mort|Eau-de-Mort]]. It keeps the inventory of the player.

Equipment and armor on a corpse can be swapped in the same way one would interact with an armor stand. If there is no equipment to swap, the corpse's inventory will open instead, allowing retrieval of the player's stuff. Or you could just hit it until it drops everything on the ground, I guess...

Any player in soul form can possess a dead player's body, equipping his stuff in the operation.
