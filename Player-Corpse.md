This special entity is spawned whenever a player dies. A player's corpse normally lasts 5 minutes, just like dropped items. During this time, it will attract nearby mobs and allow special interactions. If the [playerBodiesHoldInventory](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/wiki/Configuration#playerbodiesholdinventories) config is enabled, it will hold the player's stuff. 

Equipment and armor on a corpse can be swapped in the same way one would interact with an armor stand. If there is no equipment to swap, the corpse's inventory will open instead, allowing retrieval of the player's stuff. Or you could just hit it until it drops everything on the ground, I guess... *Disclaimer : As corpses are currently invulnerable, you will hit it for quite a long time.*

Any player in soul form can possess a dead player's body, equipping his stuff in the operation.
