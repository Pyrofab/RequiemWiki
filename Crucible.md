The crucible can do a lot of stuff in this mod. Actually, you may want to do multiple of them.

First, they can store and display a bucket worth of any liquid as well as 8 units of powder. When they are broken, they keep their content and can be used to transfer it into any valid container, other crucibles included.

When you put a crucible on a separator powered by alternative redstone current (clock or lever-spam), it will attempt to extract residues from the contained powder.

*Separation table for powders*

Water in a crucible will evaporate over time, much faster if on a heat source. You can use this property to crystallize your powders back into their item form.

Finally, you can heat up cinnabar powder to extract the mercury contained in it.

Protip : to get a crucible directly in your inventory, right-click on it while sneaking.
