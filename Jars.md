Jars are fancy buckets that can store and place mercury and water. If you enable it in the config, it can hold any liquid (Though it won't have a special texture).
If you manage to approach a will o'wisp close enough with an empty glass jar in the inventory, you'll capture it, giving you a will o'wisp in a jar. You can then release it by using the jar on the ground.
