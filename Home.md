Welcome to the Dissolution wiki !

# About

Dissolution is a mod aiming at improving Minecraft's death system, along with completing the Nether world and adding new game mechanics based on souls. Currently, its main feature is the overhaul of the respawn mechanic, replacing the old one with something more gameplay-centered and highly configurable.

## Modpacks policy
You can add Dissolution to any modpack as long as you credit its authors.

## Configuration
This mod is intended to be tweaked as the users see fit. Take a look at the Configuration section for a detailed description of each config option.

## Future versions
Dissolution is in a beta state and its design is still heavily discussed. As such, items and crafting are heavily subject to change. Its core mechanics should remain the same though.
