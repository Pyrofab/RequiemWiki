Scythes are a new type of melee weapon.

While their size makes them slow and impossible to wield without a free hand, scythes can be extremely useful against crowds of hungry monsters.

Unlike swords, scythes do not need to be fully charged to do a sweeping attack, and these will deal maximum damage to all entities within the area of effect.
Living entities killed with a scythe will fill empty bottles in the wielder's inventory with their soul, making this weapon extremely useful for mass gathering.

There are currently two scythes available in Dissolution : the iron scythe and the Grand Faux.
