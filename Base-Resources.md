Dissolution uses a few basic resources for most of its crafting.

## ![Molten Rock](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/experimental/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/mineral/molten_rock.png)![Igneous Rock](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/experimental/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/mineral/igneous_rock.png)Molten and Igneous Rocks
Molten rocks come from a fragmented magma block. They can be cooled down in a water-filled crucible, giving igneous rocks.

## ![Cinnabar](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/experimental/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/mineral/cinnabar.png)Cinnabar
Cinnabar is a shiny mineral that you can heat up to extract mercury. It can be found as residues in igneous rocks.

## ![Mercury](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/experimental/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/jars/mercury_jar.png)Mercury
This is the metal you strive for. It allows you to materialize a new body when incorporeal. Bathing in it wouldn't be a great idea though.

## ![Sulfur](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/experimental/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/mineral/sulfur.png)Sulfur
This crystal is associated with fire, earth and the Body. It can be found as residues in mineral coal.

## ![Halite](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/experimental/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/mineral/halite.png)Halite
This cousin of the salt is associated with... not much. It will probably be removed soon actually. It can be found as residues in clay.

  <summary>Removed resources</summary>

    Ectoplasm
    This material was dropped by [[lost souls|Lost-Soul]] upon death. Its only purpose was to be refined into ectoplasma through the use of the crystallizer. Removed in 0.5.

    Ectoplasma
    This is the result of the above transformation. Being more tangible than its raw counterpart, it can be used in a few recipes such as the [[Eye of the Undead|Eye-of-the-Undead]] or to create a Soul Gem. Removed in 0.5.

    Soul in a Bottle
    For some reasons, souls don't seem to be able to exit glass bottles. This behaviour allows you to safely store the souls you obtained through extraction from soul sand or harvesting from live entities. Replaced by the will o'wisp in a jar in 0.5.

    Soul Gem
    This weird component is what you obtain when you fuse crystallized, ectoplasmic material with a still uncorrupted soul. The soul inside is trapped inside the gem, making it unfit for more traditional uses but, interestingly, it acts as a catalyst with player souls. This is put to use with the creation of burials and mercurius' waystones.
