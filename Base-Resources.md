Dissolution uses a few basic resources for most of its crafting. Keep in mind, all the crafting part of this mod is the subject of intense thinking and as such, it will probably be overhauled in a future update.

## ![Ectoplasm](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/1.12/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/ectoplasm.png)Ectoplasm
This material is dropped by [[lost souls|Lost-Soul]] upon death. Currently, its only purpose is to be refined into ectoplasma through the use of the crystallizer.

## ![Ectoplasma](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/1.12/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/ectoplasma.png)Ectoplasma
This is the result of the above transformation. Being more tangible than its raw counterpart, it can be used in a few recipes such as the [[Eye of the Undead|Eye-of-the-Undead]] or to create a [[Soul Gem|Base-Resources#soul-gem]].

## ![Soul in a bottle](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/1.12/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/soul_in_a_bottle_no_animation.png)Soul in a Bottle
For some reasons, souls don't seem to be able to exit glass bottles. This behaviour allows you to safely store the souls you obtained through extraction from soul sand or [[harvesting from live entities|Scythes]].

## ![Soul Gem](https://github.com/Pyrofab/Dissolution/blob/1.12/src/main/resources/assets/dissolution/textures/items/ectoplasma.png)Soul Gem
This wierd component is what you obtain when you fuse crystallized, [[ectoplasmic material|Base-Resources#ectoplasma]] with a still uncorrupted [[soul|Base-Resources#soul-in-a-bottle]]. The soul inside is trapped inside the gem, making it unfit for more traditional uses but, interestingly, it acts as a catalyst with player souls. This is put to use with the creation of burials and mercurius' waystones.
